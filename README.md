## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Core:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Vanilla CSS for custom components)
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **UI Components:** Swiper.js (for high-performance Carousels)
- **Build Tool:** Vite

## ✨ Features & Implementation Details

### 1. Advanced API Handling

- **TanStack Query Integration:** Leverages `useQuery` and `useInfiniteQuery` for optimized data fetching, caching, and background synchronization.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Implemented "See More" functionality using `useInfiniteQuery` to seamlessly append games to the grid as users scroll.
- **Loading States:** custom skeleton loaders for every section (Game Providers, Categories, and Game Grids) to provide a smooth UX during data fetching.

### 2. Game Filtering & Search

- **Client-Side Search:** The search feature is implemented using an efficient JavaScript `.filter()` on the game names, providing instantaneous feedback without redundant API calls.
- **Category & Provider Filtering:** Global state management via **React Context API** allows users to filter games by category and provider simultaneously.

### 3. Favorites System

- **Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to persist user favorites across browser sessions.
- **Performance:** Optimized using a `Map<gameId, Game>` data structure for O(1) lookups when checking "isFavorite" status on game cards.
- **Dedicated View:** A custom `/favorites` route to view and manage all saved games.

### 4. Premium UI/UX

- **High-Performance Carousel:** Game providers are displayed in a native-feeling, swipeable carousel with autoplay and custom navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach, mimicking the fun88.mx mobile experience with smooth transitions and hover effects.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** curated HSL color palettes, glassmorphism effects, and micro-animations.
